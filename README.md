## Getting started
To get started working with the AWS MSK IAM SASL Signer for JavaScript with your Kafka client library please follow below code sample -

###### Add Dependencies
 ```sh
 $ npm install https://github.com/aws/aws-msk-iam-sasl-signer-js
 ```

###### Write Code

For example, you can use the signer library to generate IAM based OAUTH token with tulios/kafkajs library as below -

 ```js
const { Kafka } = require('kafkajs')
const { generateAuthToken } = require('aws-msk-iam-sasl-signer-js')

async function oauthBearerTokenProvider(region) {
    // Uses AWS Default Credentials Provider Chain to fetch credentials
    const authTokenResponse = await generateAuthToken({ region });
    return {
        value: authTokenResponse.token
    }
}

const run = async () => {
    const kafka = new Kafka({
        clientId: 'my-app',
        brokers: ['kafka1:9092', 'kafka2:9092'],
        ssl: true,
        sasl: {
            mechanism: 'oauthbearer',
            oauthBearerProvider: () => oauthBearerTokenProvider('us-east-1')
        }
    })

    const producer = kafka.producer()
    const consumer = kafka.consumer({ groupId: 'test-group' })

    // Producing
    await producer.connect()
    await producer.send({
        topic: 'test-topic',
        messages: [
            { value: 'Hello KafkaJS user!' },
        ],
    })

    // Consuming
    await consumer.connect()
    await consumer.subscribe({ topic: 'test-topic', fromBeginning: true })

    await consumer.run({
        eachMessage: async ({ topic, partition, message }) => {
            console.log({
                partition,
                offset: message.offset,
                value: message.value.toString(),
            })
        },
    })
}

run().catch(console.error)
 ```

## More examples of generating auth token

### Specifying an alternate credential profile for a client

```js
const authTokenResponse = await generateAuthTokenFromProfile({
    region: "AWS region",
    awsProfileName: "<Credential Profile Name>"
});
```

### Specifying a role based credential profile for a client

```js
const authTokenResponse = await generateAuthTokenFromRole({
    region: "AWS region",
    awsRoleArn: "<IAM Role ARN>",
    awsRoleSessionName: "<Optional session name>"
});
```

### Specifying AWS Credential Provider for a client

```js
const authTokenResponse = await generateAuthTokenFromCredentialsProvider({
    region: "AWS region",
    awsCredentialsProvider: fromNodeProviderChain()
});
```

Find [more examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/modules/_aws_sdk_credential_providers.html) of creating credentials provider using AWS SDK for JavaScript v3.

## Troubleshooting
### Finding out which identity is being used
You may receive an `Access denied` error and there may be some doubt as to which credential is being exactly used. The credential may be sourced from a role ARN, EC2 instance profile, credential profile etc.
If the client side logging is set to DEBUG and the client configuration property includes `logger`, and `awsDebugCreds` set to true:

```js
const authTokenResponse = await generateAuthToken({
    region: "AWS region",
    logger: console,
    awsDebugCreds: true
});
```
the client library will print a debug log of the form:
```
Credentials Identity: {UserId: ABCD:test124, Account: 1234567890, Arn: arn:aws:sts::1234567890:assumed-role/abc/test124}
```

The log line provides the IAM Account, IAM user id and the ARN of the IAM Principal corresponding to the credential being used.
The awsDebugCreds=true parameter can be combined with any of the above token generation function.

Please note that the log level should also be set to DEBUG for this information to be logged. It is not recommended to run with awsDebugCreds=true since it makes an additional remote call.
